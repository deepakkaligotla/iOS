Swift 6.0.1

Initial View Controller - first screen

iOS app architecture is changed after 13.0v
SceneDelegate is Scene Lifecycle
AppDelegate is App Lifecycle

Assets holds images, colors, data,
Info.plist - configuration of project (information property list) - permissions
LunchScreen - it is the screen which gets loaded before the first/Main screen

UIKit - user interface Kit - Library for all UI Items
didReceiveMemoryWarning - is used to clear the unused UI objects
                                            
iOS Architecture - CocoaTouch, Media Layer, Core Services, Core OS.
ViewController - View Lifecycle -
                * viewDidLoad -
                * viewDidAppear -
                * viewWillAppear -
                * viewDidDisappear -
                * viewWillDisappear -
                                            
command+shift+L to get UI Palette
CGRect - CoreGraphics RectangWSE
]=[-P09le

ViewController will have view to access - self.view
Add UI through code -  self.welcomeLabel = UILabel(frame: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 300, height: 50)) | self.view.addSubview(welcomeLabel!) (CoreGraphics)
Button events touchUpInside,

Document Outline - Components and constraints

Navigation controller is for maintaining Navigation Stack (LIFO)

Keyword - week, unknown, default(Strong)
IB - Interface Builder (Storyboard) - Objects Library 

align, add new constraints, resolve auto layout issues, embed in
* Align
* Add new constraints - left, top, right, bottom, width, height
* Resolve auto layout issues
* Embed In

If constraints applied to one view, all the view must have constraints
must to check constraint priorities -
    * Constant: <=, =, >=
    * Priorities: Required(1000), High (750), Low(250)
    * Multiplier
    
firstItem.ht = multiplier * second.ht + constant
multiplier = (firstItem.ht-constant)/second.ht

Constraints (Leading, Top, Trailing, Bottom)
(0,0) |
------------- center(0,0) set vertical & Horizontal container in Align
      |

Alignment
(-x,+y) |  (+x,+y)
------(0,0)------- center(0,0) set vertical(y) & Horizontal(x) container in Align
(-x,-y) |  (+x,-y)

**** inspector panel - file, quick help, history, size, identity, attributes, connections ****

Button - addTarget(self, action(ObjC Selector), event), and attribute inspector -> view -> tag helps with redundant code.
